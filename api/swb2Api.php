	The idea: Create a Star Wars battlefront rip off. But even that might be thinking too far
	in advance if I can't get some basic game engine to work. I'm going to have to skip straight
	from 2D graphics in canvas to WebGL. Its not that impossible because I did make a 3D rack.
	I just wish I remembered more of the stuff I spent an insane amount of time learning in the
	first place.

	Some other concepts is running some kind of hash on the client code occasionally to make sure
	it isn't being altered
